# Anonymous queue name deduction

In most cases utility packages are frameworks, they may start and manage a batch process, but there is generally not much business value about it.
For instance the CDM framework runs multiple batches where ideally you would want to configure them per document type rather than a single configuration for the whole of CDM.

We could take the outermost service (so use last instead of first), however this too can run into issues depending on the code you are running.

There are some alternatives we might consider:
- inspect the project type of the services, only take services that are not in utility packages
- check queue configuration (the only reason the name of the batch _really_ matters), there is likely only a single match in the service runtime that matches an existing queue configuration
- make it an explicit toggle when you are using the task executor to run in batch (currently it is determined by leaving the queue name empty)
