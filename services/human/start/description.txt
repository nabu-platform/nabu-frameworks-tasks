When you start working on a human task, you assign it to the human in question.
That prevents other people from picking it up and working concurrently on it.
Depending on the length of the actual task, this may take a while or be done quickly.

Once picked up, you can either finalize it (stop) or you can release it back into the pool of tasks to be done (rollback).
